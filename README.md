<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# BioLog: Never Lose Track of Characters Again

Many reading apps exist, but none solve the character management problem in literature. BioLog is different—it's the character companion you've been w for.

Reading lengthy novels means encountering countless characters that become impossible to remember. Complex relationships and evolving characters often force you to flip back through pages, diminishing enjoyment and sometimes leading to abandoned books.

Here's why:
* You shouldn't need to flip back and forth trying to remember who's who in complex novels
* Your reading experience shouldn't be interrupted by forgetting character relationships
* You shouldn't lose track of character development across long series or when taking breaks
* You should be able to easily organize characters from multiple books simultaneously
